# Search All the Movies

## First project of Unit 2

Using AJAX (jQuery's $.getJSON method), this web page pulls data from themoviedb.org and displays "Now Playing" movies. From there, the user may search movies by movie title, TV show title, or person (actor/director/etc.), and the page changes to reflect the search query. Typeahead.js is used to display partial search matches.

TODO: add modal with summary info; add isotope.

See [themoviedb.org](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/) for API information.
