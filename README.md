# Search All the Movies

## First project of Unit 2

Using AJAX (jQuery's $.getJSON method), this web page pulls data from themoviedb.org and displays a list of "Now Playing" movies. From there, the user may search movies by movie title, TV show title, or person (actor/director/etc.), and the poster images change to reflect the search query. Typeahead.js is used to display partial search matches for each set of displayed posters. Isotope with imagesLoaded is used to filter searched movies and now playing movies by genre.

TODO: add modal popups with summary info when poster images are clicked.

See [themoviedb.org](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/) for API information.
